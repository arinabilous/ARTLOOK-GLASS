            <button class="accordion wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="1s" data-wow-iteration="1">How thick is the glass?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Our glass doors range from 5/32", 3/16”, ¼”, 3/8”, and up to ½” thick. The style and cost of the door drives the thickness
                of the glass.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="3s" data-wow-iteration="1">How safe is the glass?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>All of our glass is tempered safety glass. However, it is not meant to be hung from, beat on, or slammed shut. Shower enclosures
                are not unsupervised play areas for young children.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="5s" data-wow-iteration="1">Are free estimates offered?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We do offer free estimates but recommend that you provide approximate measurements. This will ensure that we are able to
                give you a starting price point before the on-site measuring. Our service area is New York (NYC) Brooklyn, Queens,Staten
                island, Bronx, Parts of new jersey.</p>

            <button class="accordion wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="6s" data-wow-iteration="1">What types of glass is offered?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Many shades of glass are available as well as less transparent glass such as bubble glass, rain glass, and antique glass.
                We usually recommend clear glass as it usually makes the bathroom appear larger. Contact us to discuss our offerings and
                see samples.</p>

            <button class="accordion wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="6s" data-wow-iteration="1">What thickness of glass do you recommend?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>There are 3 standard thicknesses for shower doors; ¼’, 3/8’ and ½’. Call us to discuss what thickness is most appropriate
                for your shower.</p>

            <button class="accordion wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="6s" data-wow-iteration="1">Do you recommend the glass be tempered?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Yes, absolutely! Once you temper a piece of glass it instantaneously becomes 4-5 stronger. Another benefit of tempered glass
                is that if one day it ever breaks, instead of braking into large shards, it breaks into small pieces causing much less damage
                and posing less of a danger. The process that the glass goes through to become tempered is extreme heating and rapid cooling.</p>

            <h3>What is your cutting tolerance?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                 The industry-wide accepted tolerance and our cutting tolerance is +/- 1/8"

            <br>
            <p>
                 All glass contains various types of flaws or blemishes, which may be visible to the naked eye. This is unavoidable - even
                the finest raw materials contain minor flaws. The federal government mandates that no defects should be visible in the glass
                when it is viewed horizontally or vertically from 11 feet away under normal lighting. All of our glass meets these standards.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What are the size limitations?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                 The maximum size for our online store is 80" x 80". This is due to limitations on shipping process. For shipping on items
                larger than 80" x 80" please request a quote or contact our office for arrangements. However we can fabricate and install
                all sizes within our service area.
